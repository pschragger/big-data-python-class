# big-data-python-class
Source code for the big data python class

This project has been created to support the Fall 2015 "Big Data using Python"  topics class for the Computing Sciences Graduate Program of Villanova University.  It has been updated for the 2017 class and is in the process of being used for the 2018 class.
Many of the assignments and lectures are expected to change.

The intent is to support education in the use of python to address data analysis and big data problems. 

Currently the course is under development.  Expect new items to be checked in.  If you have any suggestions for topics I will create a directory structure to allow for submissions of project requests, class homeworks, alogorithms design...

Please note any submission will be in the public domain and will be covered under the license of this site so do not submit anything that is not yours.
